### Hello world!

I'm a full-stack developer and cybersecurity enthusiast among other things.   
Been working as a full-stack dev for a while now, and had the opportunity to work with a bunch of languages and technologies, such as: React, Node, Laravel, Python, relational databases like MySQL and Postgres, Docker, GraphQL, etc.
Lately I'm focusing my studies on cybersec, mainly through [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/r/p/ov33r) and portswigger.
Most important than languages and tools, I consider myself a creative and dedicated person, and I'm always willing to learn. And I still have a lot to learn, just glad it's fun.
